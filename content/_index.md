# Portfolio and Application Technical Debt Analysis with vFunction

The [AWS Modernization Phases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/strategy-modernizing-applications/phases.html) describe the 3 steps to achieve Application Modernization: Assess, Modernize and Manage.

The first step in an organization's modernization journey is to analyze the existing portfolio and identify applications that need to be modernized. This workshop will cover this step.

In this workshop, learn how to use architectural observability to measure enterprise application complexity based on code modularity and dependency entanglements, analyze the risk of changes impacting stability based on the depth and length of the dependency chains, and then aggregate these to assess the overall technical debt level. vFunction benchmarks debt, risk, and complexity against your organizationâ€™s own estate, while identifying aging frameworks that could pose future security and licensing risks. With AI-driven algorithms trained from hundreds of technical debt heavy applications, this workshop describes how vFunction gives organizations a clear picture of how much per dollar invested into the application goes towards actual innovation, versus how much goes towards managing technical debt.
