# Application Assessment

Running an assessment offline is quick and non-intrusive as we donâ€™t need to access the application runtime or source code. The assessment can be run from a users workstation.

For the assessment we need:

* The application binaries e.g. jar/war/ear
* Create a workspace
* A Java 7 and above runtime
* The vFunction viper-cli package

You can use [Assessment Hub Express SaaS](https://app.vfunction.com) to review your assessment results if you don't have a vFunction Server
