1)	Select Tab ‘Aging Frameworks’

An important part of technical debt is the aging frameworks that are used in the application. Aging frameworks are a source of security risk, and indicate an increased effort to upgrade the frameworks to their latest versions. The use of some aging frameworks will also block the application from being considered cloud-native.
This table shows the names of the jars of the frameworks that are used in the application.
Each framework, based on its current and newest version receives a tag of either modern, aging, or unknown, in case the specific jar was not found in the vFunction database.
It also shows the total number of classes that were scanned by the static analysis, and the minimal Java version that these classes were compiled with.
