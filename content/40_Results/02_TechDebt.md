1)	Select Tab ’Cost of Innovation’

This chart shows how the level of technical debt affects the cost of innovation for the application. It tries to assess if one would spend $1 on this application, how much of it will actually be put to innovation, and how much to repay the technical debt within the application.
It also details the classes that contribute the most to the overall debt, by adding complexity and risk throughout the application. The post-refactor calculation assesses the level of technical debt assuming these classes were refactored, and their level of debt reduced.

vFunction estimates the man months it would take to re-write this application.
