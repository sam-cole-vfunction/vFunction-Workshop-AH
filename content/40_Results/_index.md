vFunction Assessment Hub analyzes the technical debt of your monolithic applications, accurately identifies the source of that debt, and measures its negative impact on innovation

## Analyze Your Application Estate
vFunction Assessment Hub is a purpose-built modernization assessment platform for decision-makers. The data-driven solution analyzes and condenses data into three high-level indicators that allow you to assess, prioritize and drive immediate action on your modernization projects. vFunction Assessment Hub analyzes the technical debt of your monolithic applications, accurately identifies the source of that debt, and measures its negative impact on innovation. These metrics provide key ROI and TCO measurements critical for more effective and compelling application modernization business cases.

## Prioritize Apps for Modernization
With analysis algorithms trained from hundreds of monolithic applications, vFunction Assessment Hub gives organizations a clear picture of how much per dollar invested into the application goes towards actual innovation, versus how much goes towards managing technical debt. By further identifying the top 10 debt classes, you can see the benefits gained by simply refactoring those alone. When combined with the business value of each of these applications, organizations can stack-rank which applications to modernize first, quantify the complexity, and clearly assess the benefits of modernization.

## Build a Data-Driven Business Case
vFunction Assessment Hub delivers deep modernization metrics to build data-driven business cases for modernization. vFunction measures app complexity based on code modularity and dependency entanglements, analyzes the risk of changes impacting stability based on the depth and length of the dependency chains, and then aggregates these to assess the overall technical debt level. It then benchmarks debt, risk, and complexity against the organizationâ€™s own estate, while identifying aging frameworks that could pose future security and licensing risks.
