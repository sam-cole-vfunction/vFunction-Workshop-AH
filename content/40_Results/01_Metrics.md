1) First select the 'Tech Debt Metrics' and mouse over each Metric.

The Assessment Report shows the level of technical debt and architectural complexity in your application. Through static analysis, the report exposes how the dependencies between the classes affect the modularity of the code, the risk of impacting parts of the application and the overall level of technical debt. This level of debt affects the rate and cost of innovation and is a key business measure for the application.
Complexity is the degree to which class dependencies are entangled between themselves, reducing the level of modularity of the code. Risk is correlated to the length of the dependencies. How likely is a change in the application to affect a seemingly unrelated part of it. The debt is an overall calculation, taking into account complexity, risk and other factors to provide a single metric to prioritize the application for modernization.
The average of these three metrics in the portfolio of applications is presented to further help with the prioritization.
